# 2011 Database Management Fundamentals Final Project
In 2011, I enrolled in a pair of classes at my local community college:
one that was essentially "How to Be an Administrative Assistant", and
the other, a database management fundamentals course.
I was interested in Computer Science, and had dabbled in creating static
websites for my bands, friends' bands, and occasionally a small business
or two, but had never fully explored what the dynamic web could do for me.

This Database Management Fundamentals course changed all that. At the end
of the semester in which I took this course, I decided to enroll in the
Computer Science program full-time, and eventually completed my two-year
degree in the spring of 2013.

Since graduation, the bulk of my career has been spent working in agencies,
building custom WordPress themes for my various clients. The amount of
direct database work I've had to work on has been minimal. Over the course
of a weekend, I began digging back into MySQL, and dug out this old school
project. I thought it would be fun to rewrite this application based on
what I've learned over the years - separating logic from views, reusing
files, sanitizing input, implementing PDO and using prepared statements
in lieu of MySQL, etc. Hence, this repo.

The original completed project will be retained in the `final-project-submitted`
branch of this repo. The `master` branch, in turn will contain the latest
changes for this app, as I continue to play with the data I generated
way back in 2011, and apply everything that I've learned over the years.
